# How to update

When a new version of Skylight comes out, you need to update to it. That way you always have the latest security patches and newest features.  
Since SkyLight v0.03-beta there's a online updater. This checks at my server for the latest version, and downloads the newest version automatically from GitHub.  
Updating only involves these few steps:

- [Backup your userdata](how-to-backup-your-userdata.md)
- Go to the about panel
- Click "Update now"
- Click "Download the update"
- Click "Install the update"
- You're done!

This updates all the core files. This includes the blogging module, login functions, settings, and the entire backend. This does NOT update optional files like stylesheets and images. These can be updated at the data section in the settings panel.

ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR USERDATA. UPDATING TENDS TO BREAK STUFF
