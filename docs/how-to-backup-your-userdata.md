# How to backup your userdata

In SkyLight v0.03-beta and above follow these steps to download a ZiP file containing all your userdata.

1. Go to the settings panel
2. Scroll down to the very bottom
3. You'll see a section called "Data". Click the "Download" button.

This zipfile contains all of your userdata. This includes blogposts, pages, site-information, password (hashed), analytics, logo, and all other content from your website.

This backup can later be restored with the "Restore" button. Always make sure to create backup before updating, because updating tends to break things.
