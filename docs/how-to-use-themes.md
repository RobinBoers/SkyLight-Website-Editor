# How to use themes

So, you have a website, but it's boring? Well, in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to use super cool themes!

## Get a theme

So first, you'll need a theme. You can get themes from the official [SkyLight themelibrary](https://github.com/RobinBoers/SkyLight-themelibrary), but SkyLight also supports third-party ones. You can also make (with some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and PHP) **your own** themes. Check out this tutorial for a detailed explanation:

## Checking the theme

So, if you have a theme, you first need to check a few things:

- Does it contain all the files?  
A normal theme contains these files: blog.php, index.php, page.php, post.php, theme.css

- Is it directly in the zip, or in a subfolder?  
The files should be in the root of the zip file. If not, move them to the root of the zip file.

Always make sure that those things are right before uploading.

## Uploading the theme

Uploading your theme is relatively straightforward:

- Open the themes panel
- Click the "browse" button in the import section
- Click "Upload" 
- Done!
