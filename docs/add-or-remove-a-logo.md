# How to add or remove a logo

Some themes have logo support. This is a legacy feature (from very early versions of the editor) and isn't supported by all themes.  In some themes (like Red Blogging and Simple) a logo just doesn't fit.

For the themes that do support it, this is how to add a logo:

1. Login and open the settings panel
2. Scroll down to the "Logo & Favicon" section
3. Click "Upload new logo"
4. Select your logo and click "Upload"
5. Install a logo-compatible theme

For a tutorial about making your own themes, go here: [How to create custom themes](how-to-create-custom-themes.md)

To remove the logo, click the "Delete logo" button.
