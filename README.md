SkyLight is a flexible website builder made with html5, css3, javascript and php. It has support for third-party themes and it is highly customizable

**NOTE: SkyLight is written for PHP 7. It will not work in PHP 8. I found that out the hard way because I accedentaly updated XAMPP**

## Features

- Simple dashboard
- Logo*
- Theming API
- Blogging
- Comments*
- Menus*
- Multiple default themes (more coming soon)
- Online updating
- Encrypted passwords 
- Custom CSS Styling*

\* If the theme supports it

## Installation

Download the latest version from the releases page on this GitHub repo, and extract the zip file on the root of your server. Download `Source code (zip)` and not `package.zip`, because `package.zip` is for online updating only and doesn't work on its own. 

If you want to run a developer preview built, git clone from master:

```git clone https://github.com/RobinBoers/SkyLight-Website-Editor```  

The default password is `root`. It can be used with any username, because I haven't added, and do not plan on adding, accounts. The username you enter will appear under the posts and comments you make, but has no other effect.
